The partials directory is where the meat of the CSS is constructed.  Breaking your styles down into components (header, content, sidebar footer, etc.)

The purpose of the base partial is to load up the Sass environment so that it's easy to construct a stylesheet.  The base stylesheet sets up global variables and load all Sass modules.
