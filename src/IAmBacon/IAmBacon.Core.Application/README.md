#Application Layer
Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do. The tasks this layer is responsible for are meaningful to the business or necessary for 
interaction with the application layers of other systems.

This layer is kept thin. It does not contain business rules or knowledge. It does not have state reflecting the business situation, 
but it can have state that reflects the progress of a task for the user of the program.
