# Styles

Welcome to Styles, the pattern library for iambacon websites.

### Yay! v0.0.1 launched

Styles is very much a work in progress. The goal of version 0.0.1 was to have a documentation site up and running explaining all the parts that make up the current pattern library for [iambacon.co.uk](https://iambacon.co.uk).

If you would like to read more about why I created a pattern library and the technology choices I made, please read this post [I've finally created UI documentation for my blog with 11ty!](https://www.iambacon.co.uk/blog/ive-finally-created-docs-for-my-blog-ui-with-11ty)
